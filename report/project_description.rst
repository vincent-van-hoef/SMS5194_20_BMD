The objective of the study is to investigate differences in the bone
methylation profiles of women with/without osteoporotic fractures that had
high/low BMD. Subgroups, from the subjects of the OPRA cohort (doi:
10.1359/JBMR.0301244) of elderly women (n=1,044 at baseline), in a balanced
design of the subjects with high/low BMD who experienced no/multiple
osteoporotic fractures will be used. We have 10 patients in each group with
the same chronological age (80y). Our first goal is to identify CpG sites
that are indicative of bone density or fracture. Moreover, we have bone
phenotype measurements (pQCT) for these patients, and would like to identify
CpG sites for which the methylation levels can explain selected pQCT
variables among the patients.
